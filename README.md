# 🐦 Bird Identification Expert System
This project is a simple rule-based expert system built in Python to identify bird species based on user input. By analyzing five key characteristics — color, pattern, size, behavior, and habitat — the system matches the provided traits to known bird profiles and returns the likely species.

A simple rule-based expert system developed in Python to identify bird species based on user-provided characteristics. This command-line application simulates the reasoning process of an ornithologist by comparing traits like color, pattern, size, behavior, and habitat against a predefined bird knowledge base.

📌 Project Overview

This project demonstrates the use of expert system principles in Python. Users are prompted to describe a bird through five traits. The system then matches those inputs against a set of rules (stored as a dictionary) and identifies the closest bird species.

It's a beginner-friendly AI application designed to showcase rule-based reasoning using only Python’s built-in features—no external libraries required.
🧠 How It Works
🔍 Input Traits:

    Color — e.g., brown, yellow, vibrant blue

    Pattern — e.g., plain, ocelli, cheek patches

    Size — e.g., small, large, tiny

    Behavior — e.g., gregarious, nocturnal hunters, energetic

    Habitat — e.g., urban, forests, coastal cliffs

The program compares all five traits to identify the correct bird.
